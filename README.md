# Who's Faster Typing Game
 A two player typing game, the faster typer wins.

 ## Project Details 
 My first introduction to web development was through react and I didn't fully get to appreciate the power of html, css, and js until this journey. 
 This experience has been pretty fruitful- didn't know you could do so much with just html and css alone -  and it's helped me better understand these tools that we use to solve problems. Now, the specific problem I was trying to solve with this project was quantify whether I'm faster a typer than my best buds... by using a measuring device of my own creation, no other exists afterall hehe.

 This project presents users with an interactive keyboard display that maps to their keyboard input. It also displays a sentence that a user must type to completion. In its complete state, the site would connect two challengers together -> present them with a similar string to type -> record the time it takes them to type the string -> then compare their times upon completion.
